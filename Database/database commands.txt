	    DATABASE CONCEPTS AND COMMANDS (POSTGRESQL)

Database = It is a collection of data in form of tables which stores data in form of rows(tuples) and columns(attributes).

To Install Postgresql in ubuntu (linux)
sudo apt-get update <-- this shows updates 
Run command --> sudo get-apt install postgresql

The main files are stored in /etc/postgresql/13/main/  <-- postgresql.conf

		DATA TYPES IN POSTGRESQL

Data types should be consistent , validate , compact , performance efficient

Users can create their own custom data type using CREATE TYPE SQL command

1) NUMERICAL DATA TYPES = It consist of two-byte, four-byte, and eight-byte integers, four-byte and eight-byte floating-point numbers, and selectable-precision decimals.

2) MONETARY DATA TYPES = The money type stores a currency amount with a fixed fractional precision.

3) CHARACTER DATA TYPES = character and text comes under this data type.

4) BINARY DATA TYPES = The bytea data type allows storage of binary strings.

5) DATE/TIME DATA TYPES = It shows date and time according to query

6) Enumerated Type = enum types that comprise a static, ordered set of values.
ex = CREATE TYPE week AS ENUM ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun');

7) NETWORK ADDRESS DATA TYPE = It offers to store IPv4, IPv6, and MAC addresses.

8) ARRAY DATA TYPES = It is used to define column  of a table as a variable multidimensional array.

ex = CREATE TABLE monthly_savings (
   name text,
   saving_per_quarter integer[],
   scheme text[][]
);

8.1) Inserting into arrays = INSERT INTO monthly_savings 
VALUES (‘Manisha’, 
‘{20000, 14600, 23500, 13250}’, 
‘{{“FD”, “MF”}, {“FD”, “Property”}}’); 

8.2) Accessing Arrays = SELECT name FROM monhly_savings WHERE saving_per_quarter[2] > saving_per_quarter[4];

8.3) Modifying Arrays = UPDATE monthly_savings SET saving_per_quarter = '{25000,25000,27000,27000}'
WHERE name = 'Manisha';

8.4) Searching Arrays = SELECT * FROM monthly_savings WHERE 10000 = ANY (saving_per_quarter);

9) COMPOSITE DATA TYPES = declaring data type = CREATE TYPE inventory_item AS (
   name text,
   supplier_id integer,
   price numeric
);

9.1) Inserting Values = INSERT INTO on_hand VALUES (ROW('fuzzy dice', 42, 1.99), 1000);

9.2) Accessing Data = SELECT (item).name FROM on_hand WHERE (item).price > 9.99;

10) RANGE TYPES = It represent data types that uses a range of data.

11) OBJECT IDENTIFIER TYPES =OIDs are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys for various system tables.

12) PSEUDO TYPES = They are special-purpose entries. ex = any , anyelement , anyarray , record , trigger , void .

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		DATABASE DDL AND DML COMMANDS

1) CREATE DATABASE training = It creates database named training.

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE training;
CREATE DATABASE

2) \c dbname or \connect dbname = It is used to switch the databases.

postgres=# \connect training
psql (13.2 (Ubuntu 13.2-1.pgdg18.04+1), server 10.16 (Ubuntu 10.16-1.pgdg18.04+1))
You are now connected to database "training" as user "postgres".

3) CREATE TABLE tablename (attributes dtype(size),...); = This will create table with given attributes.

4) \d tablename = This will describes the table schema.

training-# \d student
                   Table "public.student"
  Column  |      Type      | Collation | Nullable | Default 
----------+----------------+-----------+----------+---------

 courseid | integer        |           |          | 

5) DROP DATABASE aayush; = This will drop the database.

training=# DROP DATABASE training;
ERROR:  cannot drop the currently open database
training=# exit
postgres@beryl-Latitude-E6520:/home/beryl$ psql

psql (13.2 (Ubuntu 13.2-1.pgdg18.04+1), server 10.16 (Ubuntu 10.16-1.pgdg18.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# DROP DATABASE training;
DROP DATABASE

6) DROP TABLE tablename = This drops the table from database.

training=# drop table student;
DROP TABLE

7) INSERT INTO tablename VALUES(data acc to attributes) = This insert data in table.

8) SELECT * or attname FROM tablename = This Displays data of table accordin to given condition

9) ALTER TABLE tablename (ADD,DROP,DELETE,UPDATE,RENAME TO,etc) = This Alters the table means changes the table config

10) OPERATORS = used to specify condition. ex=> =,>,<,+,-,*,/,%,^,!,!= or <> , AND , NOT , OR , & , | , ~ , << , >> , #

12) EXPRESSIONS = are like formulas or methods to get the desired output. ex= select * from employee where salary=20000;

training=# select current_timestamp;
        current_timestamp         
----------------------------------
 2021-06-08 15:23:47.453259+05:30
(1 row)

13) WHERE CLAUSE = it is used to specify a condition.

training=# select * from employee where salary>20000 and salary<50000;

training=# update employee set salary=60000 where id=3;
UPDATE 1

** modified row will display at last

16) DELETE QUERY = it deletes particular row based on some conditions.
   ** If you want to delete all the records from employee table, you don't need where clause 
simply write : delete from employee;

training=# delete from employee where id=5;
DELETE 1

17) LIKE CLAUSE = it is used to match text values against a pattern using wildcards (%,_). 
    here % means it may represent 0,1 or multiple numbers or characters.
    and _ underscore represents a single character or number.
    ** if either of two is not used in conjunction with LIKE clause , then like act as equal operator.

training=# select * from employee where salary::text LIKE '40%';
 id | name  | age |                      address                       | salary

(1 row)

18) LIMIT CLAUSE = it is used to limit the output rows. and OFFSET is used to give the rownum to start.

training=# select * from employee limit 3 offset 1;

 id |  name   | age |                      address                       | salary

			CONSTRAINTS IN POSTGRESQL

These are the rules that ensures accuracy and reliability of data.

** Constraints could be column and row level.
** Many Constraints can be used at a time on a single column.
** Commonly used Constraints are :

1) NOT NULL = It ensures that data should not be null.

2) UNIQUE = used to prevent duplicacy. It ensures that all values in column must be different.

3) PRIMARY KEY = It is used to idedntify each row/column uniquely. (UNIQUE + NOT NULL) 
   ** When multiple fields are used as primary key then it is known as COMPOSITE KEY.
   ** To drop primary key we use this syntax = ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT primary_key_constraint;

4) FOREIGN KEY = It is used to maintain referential integrity. Basically the primary key in referenced table acts as a foreign key in the referencing table. Using references keyword we can add foreign key ex = emp_id references COMPANY6(ID)

5) CHECK = It ensures that all values must satisfy certain conditions. ex = salary int check(salary>0)

6) EXCLUSION = It ensure that if any two rows are compared on the specified columns or expressions using the specified operators, at least one of these operator comparisons will return false or null.
Syntax=EXCLUDE USING gist (name with = , age with <>) here gist is type of index used to build and used for enforcement.

7) AUTO INCREMENT = it increments value by 1.by default increment value is 1.

8) PRIVILEGES = it is the permissions given to a user. generally they use GRANT/REVOKE.

testdb=# GRANT ALL ON employee TO manisha;
GRANT

testdb=# REVOKE ALL ON COMPANY FROM manisha;
REVOKE


9) ABS(Numeric Value) = It converts negative value into positive value.

airlines=# select abs(-45);
 abs 
-----
  45
(1 row)



** When we want to auto increment primary key we use serial keyword. ex=ALTER TABLE tbname ADD COLUMN ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY;

** JOINS are used to combine records from 2 or more tables in a database.

1) CROSS JOIN = Its is basically cartesian product used to evaluate the output based on some input conditions.
** No. of columns in cartesian product is (m+n) and No. of Rows in Cartesian product is (m*n)

select * from employee cross join department; 	OR	select * from employee,department; <-- Both will give same o/p i.e, Cartesian Product.

2) INNER JOIN = it creates table by combining column values of 2 tables based upon join-predicate.

** When 2 tables have same column name so we can use USING clause otherwise ON.

training=# select name from employee inner join department on employee.id=department.emp_id;
  name   
---------
 Rahul
 Karan
 Rishabh
 Mohan
(4 rows)

** Using WHERE clause with ON clause..

training=# select name from employee join department on employee.id=department.emp_id where dept='IT';
  name   
---------
 Rishabh
(1 row)


3) LEFT OUTER JOIN = here inner join is performed first,then all rows of first table + the common rows result in output. 

training=# select * from employee left outer join department on department.emp_id = employee.id order by employee.id;


 id |  name   | age |                      address                       | salary | id |                        dept                        | emp_id 
----+---------+-----+----------------------------------------------------+--------+----+----------------------------------------------------+--------
  1 | Rahul   |  20 | Faridabad                                          |  30000 |  1 | Manager                                            |      1
  2 | Karan   |  21 | Gurugram                                           |  20000 |  2 | SDE                                                |      2
  3 | Rishabh |  23 | Noida                                              |  60000 |  3 | IT                                                 |      3
  4 | Mohan   |  25 | Okhla                                              |  40000 |  4 | HR                                                 |      4

(5 rows)


4) RIGHT OUTER JOIN=here inner join is performed first,then all rows of second table + the common rows result in output.

training=# select * from employee right outer join department on department.emp_id = employee.id order by employee.id;


 id |  name   | age |                      address                       | salary | id |                        dept                        | emp_id 
----+---------+-----+----------------------------------------------------+--------+----+----------------------------------------------------+--------
  1 | Rahul   |  20 | Faridabad                                          |  30000 |  1 | Manager                                            |      1
  2 | Karan   |  21 | Gurugram                                           |  20000 |  2 | SDE                          training=# select * from employee right outer join department on department.emp_id = employee.id order by employee.id;
                      |      2
  3 | Rishabh |  23 | Noida                                              |  60000 |  3 | IT                                                 |      3
  4 | Mohan   |  25 | Okhla                                              |  40000 |  4 | HR                                                 |      4
(4 rows)

5) FULL OUTER JOIN = It is basically union of the two tables.

training=# select * from employee full outer join department on department.emp_id = employee.id order by employee.id;

			STEPS TO CREATE A DUMP FILE IN PSQL



1) First create a folder where you want to create backup file. <-- mkdir Desktop/sql_backup

2) Give permissions to that folder using chmod command. <-- chmod 0777 sql_backup

3) Now in postgres move to that folder you created for backup cd Desktop/sql_backup/

4) Then Create dump using dump command. <-- pd_dump -h localhost dbname > backupname.sql then enter your postgres user password.

   ex = pg_dump -h localhost airlines > sql_dump.sql



				RESTORE A DUMP FILE IN PSQL

1) pg_restore -U username -d dbname < filename.sql

  ** If this command didn't work , use <-- psql -d dbanme < dumpfilename.sql


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


		SCP COMMAND TO SECURELY TRANSFER FILES OR FOLDERS


1) scp filename hostname@hostipaddr:hostpath
  they say yes
  then enter hostserver password
  then file will be transferred.

2) to get your ip you can use ifconfig command.
