1) gem install rails to install rails

2) creating a new project in rails => rails new "project name" -d "database name"

3) make changes in database.yml file such as adding port number , host , username , password.

4) run rake db:create command to create a database of same name as of project name.

5) creating a new table => rails g model 'table_name'

6) to generate model/table ----> rails generate model Product name:string description:text

7) then updated no. of columns in corresponding rb file

8) then db:migrate => to change the migration in db files

9) to alter(add new column) the table use ---> rails generate migration add_email_to_students email:string

	add_column (table_name , column_name , datatype)

10) to alter(remove a column) the table use ---> rails generate migration remove_email_from_students email:string

	or remove_column (table_name , column_name)

11) can create table using this command ---> generate migration CreateProducts name:string part_number:string 

12) change column datatype ----> change_column :tablename, :columnname, :datatype

13) renaming column -----> rename_column :tablename , :columnname, :new_columnname
    change_table :oldtable , :new_tablename
14) drop table ------> drop_table(name)

15) add index -------> add_index(table_name , column_name )

16) remove index -----> remove_index(table_name , column_name )

17) To add Foreign key use add_reference keyword like : add_reference :referencing_table , :referenced_table

					
	
				18) ASSOCIATIONS 

to add associations one should know the relation between the tables they want to form

like one course can have many students     		--------> has_many :students
but many students can have only one course		--------> belongs_to :course



various (6) types of Associations are : 

a) belongs_to

b) has_one 

c) has_many

d) has_many :through			-----------> (relationship using intermediate {join} table)

e) has_one :through

f) has and belongs to many		-----------> (direrct relationship)


To make things easier, you can look at the types of Association this way:


1) has_many + belongs_to = one-to-many relationship

2) has_one + belongs_to = one-to-one relationship

3) has_many :through + belongs_to = many-to-many relationship using intermediate table

4) has_one :through + belongs_to = one-to-one relationship using intermediate table

5) has_and_belongs_to_many = many-to-many relationship  



				19)POLYMORPHIC ASSOCIATIONS


1) With polymorphic associations, a model can belong to more than one other model, on a single association.

2) Write This in Your Polymorphic Table  (Feedback)  --- >  t.references :comments, polymorphic: true

3) Update This Both things in your Both Referenced Table (here Student and Faculty Tables)for Polymorphic --- > 

has_many :feedbacks, as: :comments


4) Insert Data in Polymorphic Table (Feedback) --- > Feedback.create(content:'Good College' , comments: Student.find(1))

	Syntax : Polymorphic_table_name.create(content_column_name:'anything' , comments:Referenced_Table.find(1))
	here comments represents alias of Student and Faculty for Feedback model.



				20)ACTIVE RECORD :VALIDATIONS

1) Insert this command in model where you want to add validsations --- > validates :name, presence: true

irb> Person.create(name: "John Doe").valid?
=> true

irb> Person.create(name: nil).valid?
=> false

METHODS TO CHECK VALIDATIONS (! -- > Bang Version is used for strict validations)

update!

create!

save!



2) To Validate Email --- > validates :email , presence: true , format: /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\z/i

3) To Validate faculty_name and add custom message --- >     validates! :faculty_name, presence: {message: "must be given"}

4) To Validate a particular range --- > validates :certification_id , numericality: {less_than:7}




				21)ACTIVE RECORD :CALLBACKS


In Rails, callbacks are hooks provided by Active Record that allow methods to run before or after a create, update, or destroy action occurs to an object.





				22) CONTROLLERS IN RAILS

* The Rails controller is the logical center of your application. It coordinates the interaction between the user, the views, and the model. The controller is also a home to a number of important ancillary services.



* It is responsible for routing external requests to internal actions. It handles people-friendly URLs extremely well.

* It manages caching, which can give applications orders-of-magnitude performance boosts.

* It manages helper modules, which extend the capabilities of the view templates without bulking up their code.

* It manages sessions, giving users the impression of an ongoing interaction with our applications.

** CONTROLLER CREATION SYNTAX : rails generate controller Book


* Controller classes inherit from ApplicationController, which is the other file in the controllers folder: application.rb


* The params object is a container that enables you to pass values between method calls.



				23) SCAFFOLDING IN RAILS

* Scaffolding is a quick way to produce some major pieces of an application. For auto generating a set of models, views and controllers for a new resource in a single operation, scaffolding is used.

* Scaffolding is a technique supported by MVC frameworks in which programmers can specify how application database may be used. The framework or compiler uses it together with pre-defined code templates to generate the final code that the application can use to perform CRUD in database entries, effectively treating the templates as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.

* Scaffolding occurs at two different phases of the program lifecycle, design time and run time. 
1) Design time scaffolding produces files of code that can later be modified by the programmer.
2) Run time scaffolding produces code on the fly. It allows changes to the design of the templates to be immediately reflected throughout the application.

* Syntax to generate scaffold in rails --- > rails generate scaffold model_name

* Example : rails generate scaffold Post name:string title:string content:text 

* Scaffold Creation Example

1) Create an Application 
    rails new example  

2) create MVC components using Scaffold

    cd example  
    rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text  
    rails generate scaffold comment post_id:integer body:text  

3) first move to the application directory and then create database tables comments and post_id

    rake db:migrate  

4) Run Migrations

    rake routes  

5) Start web server

    rails server

6) Run http://localhost:3000/posts in your browser 



																						**JAVASCRIPT 


* JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.

* The Document method getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string.


* Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

* Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

* JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

1) Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
2) Writing into the HTML output using document.write().  
   Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.
   The document.write() method should only be used for testing.
3) Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
   You can skip the window keyword.
   In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object.
4) Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
   For debugging purposes. It will display all outputs in debugging mode(f12) then console window.
* To Print Page --> <button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>
ex=>  
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>


function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}


* VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT ---> var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

* CONSTANTS ---> constants are written using const PI = 3.14; They Cannot be modified once they are declared.

* Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

* JavaScript uses the Unicode character set. Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

* JavaScript identifiers (names) must begin with:

1) A letter (A-Z or a-z)
2) A dollar sign ($)
3) An underscore (_)

																	*HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

* The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
  (A consortium is a group made up of two or more individuals, companies, or governments that work together to achieving  a common objective)

* "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

* The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

* A property is a value that you can get or set AND A method is an action you can do.

* getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.

* FINDING HTML ELEMENTS

document.getElementById(id)							----->							Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name)			----->							Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name)		----->							Find elements by class name

* CHANGING HTML ELEMENTS

element.innerHTML   					----->								new html content	Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute  						----->								new value	Change the attribute value of an HTML element
element.style.property  			----->								new style	Change the style of an HTML element

Method	Description
element.setAttribute(attribute, value)	------>			Change the attribute value of an HTML element


* EVENT HANDLERS

document.getElementById(id).onclick = function(){code}	----->  Adding event handler code to an onclick event

* isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not.

* JAVASCRIPT FORMS 

function validateForm() {
  let x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Name must be filled out");
    return false;
  }
}

* In the corresponding HTML file , <form name="myForm" action="/action_page.php" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">

* Change HTML STYLE using JAVASCRIPT

document.getElementById(id).style.property = new style
ex= document.getElementById("id").style.color = "red";

* On Events JAVASCRIPT    ----->   <h1 onclick="this.innerHTML = 'Ooops!'">Click on this text!</h1>

* <h2 onclick="changeText(this)">Click on this text!</h2>

<script>
function changeText(id) {
  id.innerHTML = "Ooops!";
}
</script>

* The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

* The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.

* element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
  Note that you don't use the "on" prefix for the event; use "click" instead of "onclick".

* document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}); 

x.addEventListener("mouseover", myFunction);

* You can easily remove an event listener by using the removeEventListener() method.

* Passing Parameters ---->  element.addEventListener("click", function(){ myFunction(p1, p2); });

* DOM NAVIGATION

1)<html> is the root node
2)<html> has no parents
3)<html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
4)<head> is the first child of <html>
5)<body> is the last child of <html>

and:

6)<head> has one child: <title>
7)<title> has one child (a text node): "DOM Tutorial"
8)<body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
9)<h1> has one child: "DOM Lesson one"
10)<p> has one child: "Hello world!"
11)<h1> and <p> are siblings

* This code creates a new <p> element:

const para = document.createElement("p");
To add text to the <p> element, you must create a text node first. This code creates a text node:

const node = document.createTextNode("This is a new paragraph.");
Then you must append the text node to the <p> element:

para.appendChild(node);
Finally you must append the new element to an existing element.

This code finds an existing element:

const element = document.getElementById("div1");
This code appends the new element to the existing element:

element.appendChild(para);


<div id="div1">
  <p id="p1">This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p id="p2">This is another paragraph.</p>
</div>

<script>
const para = document.createElement("p");
const node = document.createTextNode("This is new.");
para.appendChild(node);

const element = document.getElementById("div1");
const child = document.getElementById("p1");
element.insertBefore(para, child);
</script>


* let oldChild = parentNode.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild);

* const myCollection = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

* myCollection[1] --> Accessing Collection Object

* myCollection.length ---> Defines no. of objects.

* const myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll("p"); ---> Select All <p> tags

* An HTMLCollection is a collection of HTML elements.

* A NodeList is a collection of document nodes.

* A NodeList and an HTML collection is very much the same thing.

* Both an HTMLCollection object and a NodeList object is an array-like list (collection) of objects.




					JQUERY 

* jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

* The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

* jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

* Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

1) A $ sign to define/access jQuery
2) A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
3) A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

* $(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

   $("button").click(function(){
    $("p").hide();
  });

});

* (document).ready is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

* id is selected by {#} and class is selected by {.} just like in CSS.

* Events = All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

* some different events

1) Mouse Events - click , dblclick , mouseenter , mouseleave

2) Keyboard Events - keypress , keydown , keyup

3) Form Events - submit , change , focus , blur

4) Document/Window Events - load , resize , scroll unload




					CREATING REST API's


* Rails now has the option to create an API application which is a slimmed down version of a traditional Rails web app.

* According to Rails 5 release notes, generating an API only application will:

1) Make the ApplicationController inherit from ActionController::API instead of ActionController::Base.

2) Skip generation of view files and slim-down the middleware.


					STEPS TO CREATE A NEW API


1) For Creating a new API ---> rails new rest-api-guide --api -d postgresql  or rails new rest-api-guide --api --database=postgresql


2) We specify it is an API using --api and the database using --database=.

3) Now Generating Models ---> rails generate model User username:string password:string

rails generate model Fact user:references fact:string likes:integer

* Note that user:references creates a relationship with the User model, telling us that we’ll need a foreign key called user_id. This is because we want our Fact to belong_to a User.

* If we check our models, we should see the Fact model now has the association belongs_to :user set up already. We can now add a has_many :facts relationship to User and our models will be ready to migrate:


4) IN POSTGRESQL ---> rails db:setup 	THEN rails db:migrate

5) Now we can move on to our controllers, where we will make use of RESTful architecture.

6) IN CONTROLLERS ---> We can set up our controllers much like we did with our models, except this time we are going to create them in a sub-folder ‘v1’. This is good practice for when creating future API’s where you may decide to work on an updated version (v2) whilst keeping v1 live and stable:

rails g controller api/v1/Users
rails g controller api/v1/Facts


7) Once we have our controllers loaded, we’ll need to establish our routes, which can be found in config/routes.rb.

* This is the simple option. When you use namespace , it will prefix the URL path for the specified resources, and try to locate the controller under a module named in the same manner as the namespace.


Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :users do
        resources :facts 
      end
    end
  end
end

Once set, you can check your routes using $ rails routes.

8) Change Controllers According to usage

9) Then After starting server ---> rails s ---> http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users

this will render an output like this ---> []

10) Then using console or seeds add data into your database ---> 
oliver = User.create( username: 'Oliver', password: 'password' )
fact_one = Fact.create( fact: 'Wiley Hardeman Post was the first pilot to fly solo around the world.', likes: 1, user_id: 1 )
fact_two = Fact.create( fact: 'The Symphony No1 in E flat major, K.16, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of 8.’ likes: 2, user_id: 1 )

11) Now if we check our paths: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users

{"id":1,"username":"Oliver","password":"password","created_at":"2021-07-17T06:27:06.311Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T06:27:06.311Z"}

12) Now if we check our paths: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/1/facts

[{"id":1,"user_id":1,"fact":"Wiley Hardeman Post was the first pilot to fly solo around the world.","likes":1,"created_at":"2021-07-17T06:27:34.960Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T06:27:34.960Z"},{"id":2,"user_id":1,"fact":"The Symphony No1 in E flat major, K.16, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of 8.","likes":2,"created_at":"2021-07-17T06:31:32.527Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T06:31:32.527Z"}]

	

				STEPS TO ADD SERIALIZERS A NEW API

* ActiveModel::Serializer provides a way of creating custom JSON by representing each resource as a class that inherits from ActiveModel::Serializer .

1) First of all we need to install ruby gem for serializers ---> gem 'active_model_serializers', '~> 0.10.0'

2) Run bundle install

3) Generating serializers for our models ---> rails g serializer user    and rails g serializer fact

4) Then edit serializer file --->  attributes :user_id , :fact , :likes
(used to pass only that attributes that we want to show to the users)

5) We change our serializers accordingly 

class UserSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :username, :facts

  def facts
    object.facts.map do |fact|
      {
        fact: fact.fact,
        likes: fact.likes
      } 
    end
  end
end

6) Then run Now if we check our paths: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/1


* Then we will get all the data of user 1


					SERVICE OBJECTS

* Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. ... SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.

* Service objects are Plain Old Ruby Objects (PORO) that are designed to execute one single action in your domain logic and do it well. It follows the single responsibility principle strongly.

* calling a service class ---> student = CreateStudentService.new(student_params[:name], student_params[:age], student_params[:email] , student_params[:contact_no] , student_params[:enrolled_date] , student_params[:course_id]).call

* CREATED SERVICE CLASS

class CreateStudentService
  attr_reader :name, :age, :email, :contact_no,:enrolled_date, :course_id

  def initialize(name, age, email, contact_no,enrolled_date, course_id )
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @email = email
    @contact_no = contact_no
    @enrolled_date = enrolled_date
    @course_id = course_id
  end

  def call
    Student.create(name: @name , age: @age , email: @email , contact_no: @contact_no , enrolled_date: @enrolled_date , course_id: @course_id )
  end

end


				BOOTSTRAPING IN RAILS

* you can add bootstrap in your rails project in either way by installing ---> yarn add bootstrap jquery popper.js

* or by adding it into your gem file ---> gem 'bootstrap', '~> 5.0.1'

				

			SASS(Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) IN RAILS

* Sass, (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a meta-language, which has redefined CSS for “programmers” around the world.

* You can create an .scss file in your app/javascript/stylesheets/

* you can nest same tags in order to achieve css.
for example :
#header
{
background-color:red;
color:white;
}

#header h1
{
font-size:20px;
}



* You can nest this like this using scss

#header
{
background-color:red;
color:white;

	h1
	{
	font-size:20px;
	}
}


* similarly when you are referring a parent you have to use & siugn which represents a parent.


a
{
background-color:red;
color:white;
}

a:hover 
{
text-decoration:underline;
}

* you can write the same code like this in scss

a
{
background-color:red;
color:white;

	&:hover
		{
			text-decoration:underline;
		}
}

* In sass we can define our variables for colors;
ex= $main-color: white;


* you can add mixins in order to do a particular job in scss

@mixin rounded-border{
border-radius:10px;
}

* you can use mixins by just writing @include mixin-name

* The asset pipeline enables you to store your assets in one central library.  Technically speaking, it links together your assets into one master file, reducing the number of requests made by the browser.  This can greatly speed up page  load time. (I will get back to this soon)

It also allows you to write your assets in dynamic languages, such as SASS for CSS or Coffeescript for JavaScript. As a rails developer, you may feel more comfortable with Sass and CoffeeScript, but you can still use the “base” languages to create your assets.

* You can also place your assets under

lib/assets – assets for libraries, such as jQuery.
vendor/assets – assets associated with third party apps and frameworks, such as plupload.



					AJAX IN RAILS

* Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Ajax is not a single technology; it is a suite of several technologies

* Ajax enables you to retrieve data for a web page without having to refresh the contents of the entire page. In the basic web architecture, the user clicks a link or submits a form. The form is submitted to the server, which then sends back a response. The response is then displayed for the user on a new page.

* When you interact with an Ajax-powered web page, it loads an Ajax engine in the background. The engine is written in JavaScript and its responsibility is to both communicate with the web server and display the results to the user. When you submit data using an Ajax-powered form, the server returns an HTML fragment that contains the server's response and displays only the data that is new or changed as opposed to refreshing the entire page.



					NESTED FORMS IN RAILS

* Rails provide a powerful mechanism for creating rich forms called ‘nested attributes’ easily. This enables more than one model to be combined in forms while maintaining the same basic code pattern with simple single model form. Nested attributes allow attributes to be saved through the parent on associated records. 

* The updating of the nested attribute is turned off by default and can be enabled using the class method ‘accepts_nested_attributes_for’.

* It creates a scope around a specific model object like ‘form_for’ , but doesn’t create the form tags themselves. This makes ‘fields_for’ suitable for specifying additional model objects in the same form. Although the usage and purpose of ‘field_for’ is similar to ‘form_for’, its method signature is slightly different. Like ‘form_for’ , it yields a FormBuilder object associated with a particular model object to a block, and within the block allows methods to be called on the builder to generate fields associated with the model object.

*
