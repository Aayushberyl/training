Stages of Git

1) Untracked - only those files which we don't want to commit or don't want git to look into those files
2) Staged - we add those files here which we want to commit or save in git
3) Unmodified - after commit , here file will be counted in git files
4) Modified - after editing our files will be counted at modified stage

Git Staging Areas------->> Untracked(add file)--> Staged(commit)--> Unmodified(edit file)--> Modified(stage the file)-->Staged(commit)-->Unmodified/Modified

14) git log = it shows all commits
15) git log -3 = it shows last 3 commits
16) git diff = it shows the diff b/w files (it compare working tree files with staging area files)
17) git diff --staged = it compares staging area files with last commit
18) git commit -a -m "commit message" = this skips staging area of modified files and directly commit
19) git rm --cached filename = it removes filoe from staging area not from HD
20) git rm filename = it removes file from HD also
21) git rm -f filename = it removes file forcefully and also from index

34) git pull origin master = it pull all the commits done in github files
35) git clone url foldername = it will clone the file in the folder
36) git branch -d branchname = it directly delete one branch from repository if it has not been merged. To do this command you must be present on master branch
37) git branch -D branchname = Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes
38) git branch -m branchname = it renames current branch to branchname
